  "generated_comment": "The code demonstrates a good understanding of basic event and task management. The authentication system, event handling, and task management are implemented correctly. The code also includes exception handling and follows the DRY principle. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in encapsulation, polymorphism, and the elimination of magic values. \n\n**High Priority Issues:**\n1.  **Encapsulation:** The `events` and `tasks` vectors in the `EventManager` class should be private to prevent direct access from outside the class. This violates encapsulation. (EventManager.h)\n    *   **Why:** Direct access to internal data structures can lead to unintended modifications and make the code harder to maintain.\n    *   **How:** Make the `events` and `tasks` vectors private and provide public getter methods to access them.\n    *   **Code Example:**\n        *   **Before:** `std::vector<Event> events;`\n        *   **After:** `private: std::vector<Event> events; public: const std::vector<Event>& getEvents() const { return events; }`\n2.  **Magic Values:** The code contains several magic numbers, such as `50` for `MAX_EVENT_NAME_LENGTH`, `15` for `MIN_EVENT_DURATION_MINUTES`, and `100` for `MAX_PERIODIC_EVENTS`. (EventManager.h)\n    *   **Why:** Magic numbers make the code harder to understand and maintain. If the value needs to be changed, it has to be updated in multiple places.\n    *   **How:** Define these numbers as named constants at the beginning of the file.\n    *   **Code Example:**\n        *   **Before:** `if (name.length() > 50)`\n        *   **After:** `const int MAX_EVENT_NAME_LENGTH = 50; if (name.length() > MAX_EVENT_NAME_LENGTH)`\n\n**Medium Priority Issues:**\n1.  **Polymorphism:** The code does not effectively use polymorphism. Consider using inheritance to create a base `Item` class for both `Event` and `Task` and then derive `Event` and `Task` classes from it. This would allow you to treat events and tasks generically.\n    *   **Why:** Polymorphism can reduce code duplication and make the code more flexible and extensible.\n    *   **How:** Create a base class with common properties and methods, and then derive `Event` and `Task` from it.\n2.  **Inconsistent Indentation:** The indentation is not consistent throughout the code. (Multiple files)\n    *   **Why:** Inconsistent indentation makes the code harder to read and understand.\n    *   **How:** Use a consistent indentation style (e.g., 4 spaces) throughout the code.\n\n**Low Priority Issues:**\n1.  **Consistency:** While naming is generally good, there are some inconsistencies. For example, `start_time` and `end_time` are snake_case, while `startTime` and `endTime` would be more consistent with other variable names.\n    *   **Why:** Consistency in naming conventions makes the code easier to read and understand.\n    *   **How:** Choose a naming convention and stick to it throughout the code.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1.  Implement the encapsulation improvements by making the `events` and `tasks` vectors private and providing getter methods. (High Priority)\n2.  Replace all magic numbers with named constants. (High Priority)\n3.  Refactor the code to use polymorphism for events and tasks. (Medium Priority)\n4.  Ensure consistent indentation throughout the code. (Medium Priority)\n5.  Review and fix any naming inconsistencies. (Low Priority)"
