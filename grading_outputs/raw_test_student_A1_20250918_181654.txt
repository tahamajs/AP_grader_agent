  "generated_comment": "The code demonstrates good use of containers and function decomposition. The main function is clean and the functions are generally small and focused. However, there are several areas for improvement. **High Priority:** 1. Add comments to explain the purpose of functions and complex logic. Currently, there are no comments in the code. 2. Eliminate magic numbers. The code uses hardcoded values like in `getStartMinutes` and `getEndMinutes` which should be replaced with named constants. **Medium Priority:** 3. Implement input validation to handle invalid time formats or event names. 4. Consider using iterators for more efficient container traversal, although the current implementation using indices is acceptable for this assignment. **Low Priority:** 5. Improve I/O separation further by creating dedicated functions for reading input and displaying output. **Code Example (Magic Numbers):** Instead of `sscanf(start_time.c_str(), \"%d:%d\", &hours, &minutes); return hours * 60 + minutes;`, define `const int MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60;` and use `return hours * MINUTES_PER_HOUR + minutes;`. **Code Example (Comments):** Add comments like `// This function checks if a new event conflicts with existing events` before the `hasTimeConflict` function. **Next Steps:** 1. Add comments throughout the code. 2. Replace magic numbers with named constants. 3. Implement input validation."
